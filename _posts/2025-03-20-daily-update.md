We spent time trying to dice Hiroko's proof once again, only to figure out we're both incredibly confused by that piece of math. With that, we changed our focus to the concically smooth case depth 1 case of the Whitney embedding theorem, and that's what I'll be setting my attention towards the next couple of days. John asked me formalize, in writing, some of my thouhgts about the strategy of the proof.

I am still listeing to Keir Giles' "Who Will Defend Europe" on Audible during car trips--it's been proving a little less interesting than I thouhgt it would be. I am starting to realize that this is something that happens with me everytime I pick a book about defence or geopolitics; I always expect I will learn a lot about why defence systems are getting more sophsticated, and how this is affecting strategy and even tactical prepearations. In othe words, I am looking for little insights of how militaries
