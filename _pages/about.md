I am a mathematician at Instituto Superior Técnico and a member of [CAMGSD](https://camgsd.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/index.php?lang=en) (Center for Analysis, Geometry, and Dynamical Systems), working at the intersection of mathematical physics and algebraic topology. I am currently in the last year of my PhD, which has been funded by an [FCT](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.fct.pt/en/&ved=2ahUKEwizmZyploKMAxWJRfEDHbjsE44QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2LM4ShTH7kpKpA0eeL1gDa) grant. 

My work centers around quantum topology. I am interested in using physics, especially condensed matter physics, as a way to construct global algebraic invariants of manifolds. To do this, there is a host of modern mathematical tools like $$\infty$$-categories

My thesis (to be finished), is about constructing an *$$(\infty,n)$$-category of stratfied cobordisms with defects*. This is part of an ongoing effort to better understand 

I was advised by [John Huerta](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~jhuerta/&ved=2ahUKEwjBx53mmYKMAxX3RPEDHdjuGk4QFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1YsN_eNU168YlFn0Sm6fDQ) and co-advised by [Roger Picken](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~rpicken/&ved=2ahUKEwitsPz1mYKMAxX7SvEDHcGzBdAQFnoECA0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw20fUFfromuhiilETkzW3Na).

I also have work about beta factorization homology and topological quantum field theories that should be turning into a final pre-print before mid-2025.

I have an [MSc in Mathematics from Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/education/courses/masters-programmes/applied-mathematics-and-computation/#) (also part of the University of Lisbon, these days) for which I received an [Academic Excellence Diploma](https://conselhopedagogico.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/files/sites/32/diplomas-e-quadros-de-meritov_2024-2.pdf), and a [BSc in Applied Mathematics and Computation](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/education/courses/undergraduate-programmes/applied-mathematics-and-computation/) also from IST. 

I have been teaching at [NOVA School of Business Economics](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/) since 2022. So far, I have taught:

- Linear Algebra with Programming.
- Data Analysis and Probability. 

I worked for a brief period at [CMVM](https://www.cmvm.pt/) (the Portuguese SEC) doing Cybersecurity and teaching crytpography to the agency.
